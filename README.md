Developed a Dehazing model with object detection using Dark Channel Prior Algorithm and YOLOv5 for improved image clarity. 
Implemented video dehazing using Dark Channel Prior Algorithm with structural similarity measurement, achieving high fidelity between dehazed and original videos. Additionally, integrated real-time object detection. 
Built a user-friendly web application using Streamlit for video and object detection. This allows users to upload hazy videos and receive dehazed videos with identified objects. 
Designed a system with the potential to significantly improve firefighter situational awareness during indoor fire emergencies. This is achieved by removing haze from video feeds and detecting humans/objects in real-time, ultimately aiding rescue efforts and minimizing property damage.
